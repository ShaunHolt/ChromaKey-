# ChromaKey-
Using the colors of pixels in the image to allow pixel substitution from other images. Take a picture of a person wearing a red shirt in front of a green canvas and make the background look like another locale and their T-shirt have a new design. The other pictures that will replace the background and shirt can be used from pictures in media sources or from internet.
